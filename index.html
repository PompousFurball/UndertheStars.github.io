<p>Hello, and welcome! I'm pompousFurball, and this is my website. Here, I will be hosting my written works for all to read! Content warnings (if applicable) will be included with each story. Audio files are included to "set the mood", but it's up to you whether or not you want to play them. With that out of the way, why not sit down for a tale or two? </p>
